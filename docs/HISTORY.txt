Changelog
=========

0.4.0
-----

 * The runnable script name has been changed again to **duplicatefinder** (no more .py to be able to
   obtain a better *.deb* package).
 * Release of the program also as Debian/Ubuntu package.

0.3.0
-----

 * The runnable script name has been changed to **duplicatefinder.py**.
 * You can now pass multiple target directories as parameters.
 * Added a **--action=ask** option for choosing at every duplicate what action perform (interactive mode).
 * Added the **--include-dir** option for limit the search only to specific directories.
 * Added the **--exclude-dir** option for skipping the search from some directories.
 * Added the **--include-file** option for match only some files in the search.
 * Added the **--exclude-file** option for skipping files from the search, based on file name.
 * Using a wrong directory name was not handled, but was producing only abnormal termination.
 * More kindly handle of the *break* (CTRL+C) user's action.
 * Added the **--verbose** option to print some more message infos.
 * Added the **--quiet** option to output nothing at all.
 * Removed the *_same_file* function. Python already have a `filecmp`__ module (hoping this is faster)!
 * Added environment for automated tests, and tests too (use the *--action=tests*).
 * Some fixes to the command line help.
